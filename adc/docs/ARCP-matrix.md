# ARCP Implementation Matrix

This matrix maps the normative [Agent Rules of Civil Procedure (ARCP)](ARCP.md) to current engine behavior, with [Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP): U.S. Courts](https://www.uscourts.gov/rules-policies/current-rules-practice-procedure/federal-rules-civil-procedure) as the external baseline.

Status labels:

- `Done`: explicit executable support exists.
- `Partial`: some executable support exists, but coverage is limited.
- `Gap`: no direct executable support.
- `Abrogated`: matches FRCP/ARCP abrogated status.

Roadmap labels:

- `Soon`: near-term roadmap.
- `Later`: distant roadmap.
- `TBD`: likely not addressed anytime soon.

## Coverage summary

The current matrix marks 95 rules or rule groups.  Coverage is uneven and still early in many FRCP areas.

| Status | Count |
|---|---:|
| Done | 16 |
| Partial | 24 |
| Gap | 51 |
| Abrogated | 4 |

Most open work remains in discovery depth, deposition stack, jury-instruction workflows, and post-judgment procedural detail.

## Priority gaps for ARCP fidelity

High-value missing areas for near-term ARCP completeness:

1. Rule 51 jury-instruction workflow.
2. Rule 26(e) supplementation and integration with Rule 37 consequences.
3. Protective-order enforcement in discovery/PACER visibility.
4. Deposition stack (Rules 30-32) if discovery realism is a near-term goal.
