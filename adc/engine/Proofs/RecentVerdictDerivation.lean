Verdict derivation stops if any sworn juror has not yet voted in the current
round, provided enough sworn jurors still remain to reach the configured
threshold.

The timeout rule added one earlier exit: if too few sworn jurors remain, the
engine declares a hung jury immediately.  This theorem states the remaining
completeness boundary.  When the jury is still large enough to reach the
threshold, the engine may derive neither a verdict nor a hung jury nor a new
ballot round until every sworn juror has a ballot in the active round.

/- 
This theorem marks the remaining formal boundary of the verdict logic.

Once the jury still has enough sworn jurors to reach the threshold, a complete
current round is the first hard precondition of verdict derivation itself.

/--
When plaintiff votes meet the concurrence threshold, the engine returns a
plaintiff verdict with the arithmetic mean of plaintiff-side damages.

The proof checks the derived verdict summary rather than whole-structure
equality.  That is the right statement in Lean because the verdict contains a
`Float`, and decidable equality on the enclosing structure is unavailable.
-/
theorem deriveVerdictFromJurorVotes_plaintiff_majority_uses_plaintiff_mean :
    plaintiffMajorityVerdictSummary = true := by
  native_decide

/- 
The proof checks the damage field by its bit pattern.

That avoids a proof artifact from Lean's `Float` representation while keeping
the substantive claim exact: the derived amount is `100.0`, the mean of the
four plaintiff-side damages.
-/

/--
When defendant votes meet the concurrence threshold, the engine returns a
defendant verdict with zero damages.

Plaintiff-side damages claims do not survive a defendant verdict.  The proof
checks the verdict fields that carry that legal consequence.
-/
theorem deriveVerdictFromJurorVotes_defendant_majority_zeroes_damages :
    defendantMajorityVerdictSummary = true := by
  native_decide

/- 
This proof uses the same summary style as the plaintiff-side theorem.

That keeps the theorem exact about the verdict's content while avoiding the
same `Float` equality problem on the enclosing structure.
-/

/--
Reordering the sample plaintiff-majority votes does not change the derived
verdict summary.

This theorem proves the verdict derivation does not depend on the order of the
vote list in the representative plaintiff-majority case.  The engine should
count votes and average plaintiff-side damages, not care about storage order.
-/
theorem deriveVerdictFromJurorVotes_plaintiff_majority_is_order_invariant_on_sample :
    plaintiffMajorityPermutedVerdictSummary = plaintiffMajorityVerdictSummary := by
  native_decide

/- 
This theorem checks order invariance at the point where it matters.

The current derivation code counts votes and computes the mean of
plaintiff-side damages.  Those operations should be permutation-invariant, and
the sample theorem proves that behavior on a nontrivial reordered vote list.
-/

/--
If round 2 repeats round 1 with the same split and the same damages positions,
the engine declares a hung jury.

This theorem states the new deliberation stop rule directly.  The proof checks
the emitted hung-jury record, including the explanatory note.
-/
theorem deriveVerdictFromJurorVotes_stable_split_declares_hung_jury :
    stableSplitHungJurySummary = true := by
  native_decide

/- 
The hung-jury theorem matters because it rules out empty extra rounds.

Once the split and damages positions stop moving, the engine must stop the jury
process rather than continue to solicit identical ballots.
-/

/--
If a split round is not yet stable and neither side has the required
concurrence, the engine advances to the next round.

This is the positive side of the deliberation loop.  The engine keeps the jury
voting when the prior round changed but still failed to produce a verdict.
-/
theorem deriveVerdictFromJurorVotes_nonstable_split_advances_round :
    continuingSplitAdvanceSummary = true := by
  native_decide

/- 
This theorem distinguishes disagreement from deadlock.

A split vote does not end the process by itself.  The engine advances only when
the jury still has a live path to movement under the round cap.
-/
