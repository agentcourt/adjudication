/--
A closed case has no available opportunities, regardless of roles or phase.

The proof plan is direct.  `availableOpportunities` checks `req.state.case.status`
first and returns the empty list immediately when the status is `closed`.  After
unfolding the definition, `simp` with the status hypothesis finishes the proof.

theorem availableOpportunities_nil_when_case_closed
    (req : OpportunityRequest)
    (hclosed : req.state.case.status = "closed") :
    availableOpportunities req = [] := by
  unfold availableOpportunities
  simp [hclosed]

/-
This is the reusable closed-case theorem that the older concrete `closedReq`
example was pointing at.  It is more useful than the concrete example because
later proofs can apply it to any state that reaches `closed`.
-/

/--
A closed case has no current open opportunity.

The proof plan uses the previous theorem.  `currentOpenOpportunity?` selects
from `openOpportunities`, which in turn filters `availableOpportunities`.  Once
the available-opportunity list is empty, the current open opportunity is `none`.
-/
theorem currentOpenOpportunity_none_when_case_closed
    (req : OpportunityRequest)
    (hclosed : req.state.case.status = "closed") :
    currentOpenOpportunity? req = none := by
  unfold currentOpenOpportunity? openOpportunities
  rw [availableOpportunities_nil_when_case_closed req hclosed]
  simp [selectLowestPriorityOpportunity?]

/-
This theorem is the real bridge to later step-level results.  If a successful
action closes the case, later orchestration proofs can stop at this lemma
instead of re-unfolding the opportunity machinery.
-/

/--
A closed case makes `nextOpportunity` terminal.

The proof plan combines `currentOpenOpportunity_none_when_case_closed` with the
existing equivalence between terminal responses and missing current
opportunities.

theorem nextOpportunity_terminal_when_case_closed
    (req : OpportunityRequest)
    (hclosed : req.state.case.status = "closed") :
    (nextOpportunity req).terminal = true := by
  rw [nextOpportunity_terminal_iff_no_currentOpenOpportunity]
  exact currentOpenOpportunity_none_when_case_closed req hclosed

/-
This is the summary orchestration fact for closed cases.  It states the public
effect of closure directly in terms of `nextOpportunity`, which is the boundary
the Go runner actually uses.
