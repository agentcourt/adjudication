Empanelment preserves juror identity fields on a representative mixed panel.

The sample includes selected candidates, an unselected candidate, and a juror
already removed for cause.  The theorem checks that empanelment changes only
status, not id, name, note, model, or persona file.
-/
theorem empanelSelectedJurors_preserves_identity_projection_on_sample :
    (empanelSelectedJurors sampleVoirDirePanel sampleSelectedJurors).map jurorIdentityProjection =
      sampleVoirDirePanel.map jurorIdentityProjection := by
  native_decide

/- 
This sample theorem checks the exact list transformation the engine performs.

It does not reason abstractly about all panels.  It proves the identity
continuity claim on a panel that exercises the three status paths the current
empanelment code can take.
-/

/--
Selected jurors become sworn on the sample panel.

This theorem checks one of the selected jurors directly through the same
`jurorById?` helper the runtime uses for later jury operations.
-/
theorem empanelSelectedJurors_marks_J2_sworn_on_sample :
    (jurorById? (empanelSelectedJurors sampleVoirDirePanel sampleSelectedJurors) "J2").map
        (fun juror => juror.status) =
      some "sworn" := by
  native_decide

/--
The second selected juror also becomes sworn on the sample panel.

The sample selects two jurors so the theorem set does not depend on a single
position or a single id.
-/
theorem empanelSelectedJurors_marks_J4_sworn_on_sample :
    (jurorById? (empanelSelectedJurors sampleVoirDirePanel sampleSelectedJurors) "J4").map
        (fun juror => juror.status) =
      some "sworn" := by
  native_decide

/--
An unselected candidate becomes `excused_after_voir_dire` on the sample panel.

This is the negative half of selection.  Empanelment records that a remaining
candidate was left off the jury instead of dropping the juror from state.
-/
theorem empanelSelectedJurors_marks_J1_excused_on_sample :
    (jurorById? (empanelSelectedJurors sampleVoirDirePanel sampleSelectedJurors) "J1").map
        (fun juror => juror.status) =
      some "excused_after_voir_dire" := by
  native_decide

/--
Once every remaining candidate has a questionnaire response and one answered
oral question from each side, the selection record is ready for empanelment.

The theorem does not claim that empanelment is the only open action.  Counsel
may still choose challenges or peremptories.  It proves the narrower boundary
that matters for the current design: no candidate still needs questionnaire
work or party questioning, and the judge's empanelment opportunity is now
available.
-/
theorem ready_voir_dire_panel_exposes_empanelment_boundary :
    readyVoirDireBoundarySummary = true := by
  native_decide

theorem passing_last_voir_dire_question_still_leaves_next_opportunity :
    voirDireQuestionPassLeavesFurtherOpportunity = true := by
  native_decide

/- 
This theorem captures the point at which the jury record is complete enough to
seat the jury.

It checks both halves of the claim: candidate-specific questioning is done,
and the judge can now empanel the jury from the remaining candidate panel.
-/

/--
Granting a pending for-cause challenge removes exactly one candidate from the
available panel on the representative voir-dire state.

The proof checks both effects that matter.  The candidate count drops by one,
and the targeted juror's status becomes `excused_for_cause`.
-/
theorem decide_juror_for_cause_challenge_granted_reduces_candidate_count_on_sample :
    grantedForCauseSummary = true := by
  native_decide

/- 
This theorem makes the selection arithmetic explicit for for-cause rulings.

The engine does not silently drop the juror or change unrelated jurors.  It
records one specific status change, and that change reduces the candidate
panel by one.
-/

/--
A peremptory strike removes exactly one candidate from the available panel on
the representative voir-dire state.

The proof checks the same two effects as the for-cause theorem: one fewer
candidate remains, and the targeted juror's status becomes
`struck_peremptory`.
-/
theorem strike_juror_peremptorily_reduces_candidate_count_on_sample :
    peremptoryStrikeSummary = true := by
  native_decide

/- 
This theorem states the peremptory effect in the same operational terms as the
for-cause theorem.

That parallel matters.  The two selection devices differ in legal basis, but
both should change the remaining candidate panel in one clear, countable way.
-/

/- 
Together, the sample theorems cover the core empanelment effects.

They show that empanelment preserves identity, promotes selected candidates to
sworn jurors, and records non-selection explicitly for remaining candidates.
