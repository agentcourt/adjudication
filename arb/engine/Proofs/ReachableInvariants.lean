This file states the larger procedural theorem that the earlier files were
preparing to prove.

`Reachable` is the engine's own notion of a valid history: one successful
initialization followed by zero or more successful public `step` calls.  The
question now is no longer local.  It is global.

Do those public transitions preserve the intended procedural structure across
every state the engine can produce?

For the first global theorem, the answer is yes.  Every reachable state keeps
the merits sequence in order.  The proof is an induction on `Reachable`.  The
base case is initialization.  The step case is a case split on the public
action type, delegating to the step-preservation theorems proved earlier.

Once that theorem is in place, the fairness summary follows immediately.
`proceduralParity` was designed as a smaller consequence of `phaseShape`, not
as an independent property with its own separate induction.

Every reachable state preserves the intended merits sequence.

This theorem is the first full engine invariant.  It no longer speaks about
one helper function or one sample trace.  It speaks about every state the Lean
engine can produce through successful public transitions.

Every reachable state satisfies the procedural parity summary.

This theorem is intentionally short.  The real work is in
`reachable_phaseShape`.  `proceduralParity` then follows from the structural
theorem already proved in `ProcedureShape.lean`.
