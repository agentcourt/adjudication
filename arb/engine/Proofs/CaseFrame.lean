This file proves that initialization fixes the identity of the case.

The current global invariants say that reachable states preserve structural
properties: phase order, side-to-side parity, and aggregate material limits.
Those theorems do not yet say whether the engine might quietly change the case
being adjudicated.

That risk has three parts.

First, the proposition should remain fixed.  The engine should not begin by
adjudicating one claim and then silently switch to another.

Second, the governing policy should remain fixed.  The vote threshold,
character limits, and material caps should not drift after initialization.

Third, the set of council identities should remain fixed.  Member status may
change in deliberation, but the case should not replace one decision maker with
another mid-run.

These three fields form the case frame.  The theorems below show that a
successful initialization establishes that frame and that every successful
public `step` preserves it.

Successful initialization fixes the initial case frame.

Initialization trims and stores the proposition, copies the policy from the
draft state, and reseats the supplied council list without changing member

Every successful public step preserves the case frame.

The proof follows the public action boundary rather than the internal helper
functions.  That is the right level for the invariant, because `Reachable` is
defined in terms of successful public `step` calls.

Any run that begins at a successful initialization preserves the initialized
case frame.

This theorem is the public statement of the file.  It connects the
initialization request to every later state in the same successful run.
