This file defines the shared language for global procedure theorems.

The first proof batch used concrete sample states.  The next batch needs a
notion of all states that the engine can actually produce.  That is the purpose
of `Reachable`.

`Reachable s` means that `s` arose from one successful initialization, followed
by zero or more successful `step` transitions.  The definition does not talk
about the Go runner.  It talks only about the Lean engine's own transition
functions.  That is the right level for the global invariants, because the
claims are about what the engine permits, not about one caller.

The same file also defines the sequence predicates used by the fairness
theorems.  The bilateral phases have a specific order: plaintiff first, then
defendant.  The optional phases have a specific side: plaintiff for rebuttal,
defendant for surrebuttal.  The sequence predicates say exactly that.

Some later theorems need to talk about what part of a case remains fixed once
initialization succeeds.

The proposition is the issue being adjudicated.  The policy is the governing
procedure for that run.  The council-member identifiers determine who the
decision makers are, even though later steps may update council-member status.

Those three components form the case frame.

The engine code and the proof layer count by two different definitions.

The executable functions in `Main.lean` use `foldl`.  The proof predicates in
this directory use `filter` and `length`.  They measure the same quantity.
These lemmas let later proofs move between the executable guard logic and the
global invariants without carrying that translation by hand each time.
