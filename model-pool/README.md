# Model Pool

`model-pool/` builds the juror and council model pools that `adc run`, `aar run`, and `aard run` draw from.  The tools evaluate models and pinned OpenRouter provider endpoints against JSON-scored question sets, build endpoint inventories, collect behavior-prompt responses, cluster embeddings, and sample endpoint/persona pools into a `pool.jsonl` of request-spec records.  Generated run files belong under `results/`; versioned inputs belong under `sets/`, `schemas/`, `rubrics/`, `prompts/`, `config/`, `genes.json`, `sampled-genes.json`, and `variants/`.  Persona text comes from `../common/etc/personas/`, the same corpus the runtimes read when a pool record names a persona.

A provider endpoint is the unit of evaluation, because one OpenRouter model ID can route to several endpoints that differ in provider, quantization, context limit, supported parameters, pricing, and behavior.  Behavior evals of the adjudication actors themselves are a separate concern and live under [Evals](../evals/README.md).

Use `model-pool/` as the working directory unless a command says otherwise.  OpenRouter calls require `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` or ignored `secrets/openrouter.api.txt`.  Embedding runs require `OPENAI_API_KEY` or ignored `secrets/openai.api.txt`.

| [Documentation Index](docs/README.md) | Sampling runbook, model inventory notes, and the legacy CSV pool pipeline. |

## Quick Checks

Run these commands from `model-pool/` before changing items, prompts, schemas, configs, or sampling inputs.  The validation commands check question records and fixture references.  The audit checks repository consistency for the eval inputs and tool references.

```bash
uv run tools/score_eval.py validate-items --questions sets/core20/questions.jsonl
uv run tools/score_eval.py validate-items --questions sets/deliberation/questions.jsonl
uv run tools/audit_eval.py --json
```

Use the mock runner for a deterministic local test that does not call OpenRouter.  The first command writes a local run under `results/`.  The second command scores that run with the deterministic scorer.

```bash
uv run tools/run_eval.py --mock perfect --models mock:perfect --out results/mock-perfect
uv run tools/score_eval.py score --run results/mock-perfect
```

## Run Data

Run outputs, model responses, score files, manifests, provider inventories, sampled pools, and run-specific summaries belong under `results/`, or under an intentional snapshot directory in `variants/` when the repository needs a checked-in survivor set.  `results/` is ignored except for `results/.gitkeep`, and credentials are ignored under `secrets/`.  README content stays limited to stable workflow, file locations, and entry points; run IDs, endpoint counts, pass rates, accepted endpoint lists, and dated filter details belong in run artifacts, snapshot summaries, analysis notes, or the manual.
